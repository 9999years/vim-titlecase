Vim Titlecase
=============

Titlecase is a vim plugin that adds a new operator (command that takes a text
object or motion to act on) for titlecasing text.

       this is some text  |  this is Some text
     method('some args')  |  method('Some Args')
            a title line  |   A Title Line

The plugin provides two operators:

  <Plug>Titlecase
  <Plug>TitlecaseLine
